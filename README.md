# Image_Captioning_using_Attention

Traditionally, image captioning systems relied heavily on handcrafted features and linguistic rules to generate captions. However, these approaches often suffered from limited generalization and lacked the ability to capture the diverse and intricate visual semantics of images. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can effectively learn relevant image features and focus on specific regions of interest, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant captions. Through this project, we seek to develop an efficient algorithm that will accurately understand images and enable machines to generate more human-like and contextually meaningful descriptions for them.

The main objective of our project is to develop an image captioning system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Units, and Attention Mechanisms to generate accurate and relevant image captions. In order to achieve that, we aim to address the following challenges so that our system not only produces captions closely aligned with human descriptions but also demonstrates a high degree of generalization:
- Feature Extraction: Utilizing CNN architectures and pre-trained models to extract meaningful image features that capture both low and high-level image details
- Attention Mechanism: Implementing an attention mechanism that enables our system to adaptively allocate attention to different image regions based on their significance
- Language Generation: Developing a language model that generates accurate captions describing the images
- Evaluation:  Assessing the performance (BEAM Search) of our model through BLEU score
We further test our image captioning modelâ€™s robustness against adversarial attacks, which alter input data in small ways to deceive machine learning models and generate misleading captions by performing gradient descent on the image features itself.
